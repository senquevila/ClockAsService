# Functional Requirements for ClockAsService (MCP Context)

## Overview
ClockAsService is a backend service for managing alarms and events, designed for integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) systems.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Alarm Management
- Create an alarm with a unique identifier and a target time.
- Retrieve the countdown (remaining time) to the alarm's target.
- List all active alarms.
- Delete or update an alarm.

### 2. Event Management
- Create an event with a unique identifier and a start time.
- Retrieve the elapsed time since the event started.
- List all active events.
- Delete or update an event.

### 3. Service Operations
- Provide RESTful API endpoints for all alarm and event operations.
- Return responses in JSON format for easy MCP integration.
- Validate input data (e.g., time formats, unique IDs).

### 4. MCP Integration Context
- Expose service metadata and available operations for MCP discovery.
- Support context queries from MCP clients (e.g., get current alarms/events, get time to next alarm).
- Allow MCP clients to subscribe to alarm/event changes (optional, for advanced integration).

### 5. Error Handling
- Return meaningful error messages for invalid requests (e.g., alarm/event not found, invalid time).
- Log errors and service activity for monitoring.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Written in Go (Golang) for performance and reliability.
- Use in-memory storage for initial implementation (can be extended to persistent storage).
- Easy to extend for future MCP features.
